config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBLVGL
	bool "liblvgl"
	help
	  Build and install libraries to support the
	  Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). This requires
	  an externally provided lv_conf.h file to handle the build
	  configuration.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBLVGL_LVCONF
	string "Path to lv_conf.h to build against"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_LIBLVGL
	help
	  Path to the lv_conf.h file used to configure the LVGL build.

	  Note that this is required in order to build a useful LVGL
	  library!

	  The path can be a URL beginning with ftp://, http://,
	  or https://. Otherwise, it will be assumed to be a file on
	  disk and will be copied from that path.
