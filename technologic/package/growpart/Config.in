	  Script to automatically resize a partition.

	  This has the advantage of being able to run every time, if the disk
	  cannot reasonably be expanded, the command will indicate so via return.
	  This allows for it to be run safely every boot and only actually affect
	  a disk on first run.

	  growpart is provided as a script in the toolset cloud-utils. This
	  package installs just the growpart script and none of the other tools.
