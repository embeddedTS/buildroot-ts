	help
	  Pre-built binary blob for making bootable SD/eMMC devices.

	  This is based on the 2014.10 U-Boot release which requires
	  an older gcc 4.4 compiler which is not possible to build
	  in modern Buildroot release. In order to still support this
	  platform, this package provides a binary used as part of the
	  final image build.

	  THIS IS REQUIRED FOR A BOOTABLE TS-7670 IMAGE!
