	  The TS products that offer TS-SILO supercapacitor support
	  will have a monitor daemon as part of their utilities
	  repository.

	  By default, the script is installed but does not have a
	  startup process. Enabling this will add a SysV init style
	  script to start and stop the daemon.

	  It is installed as S99tssilomon
