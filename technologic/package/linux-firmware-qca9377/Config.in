	  This is a transition package to support BT on the Silex
	  Wi-Fi / BT module on embeddedTS platforms. Support for
	  installing this firmware normally has been proposed upstream,
	  but this is added here until that makes it in to a release.

	  This package provides various binary firmware files (closed
	  binary blobs) for such devices like LAN, WLAN cards etc.
