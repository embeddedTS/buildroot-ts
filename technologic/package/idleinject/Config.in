	  Userspace CPU Idle Injector

	  Intended for a38x CPUs which do not have correct in-kernel
	  thermal throttling support at this time. Compatible with
	  nearly every other CPU as well.

	  Monitors thermal zone 0 and pauses userspace applications in
	  situations when temperatures are running high.

	help
	  Temperature, in millicelcius, when the idleinject tool kicks
	  in and pauses userspace processes to reduce CPU temperature.
