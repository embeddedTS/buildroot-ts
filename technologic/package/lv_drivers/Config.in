	  Drivers package for LVGL. This provides a number of interface
	  routines for things such as libinput, fbdev, wayland, etc. It
	  builds and installs libraries to the target and provides
	  headers and libraries for compilation of other packages.

	  This requires LVGL to be enabled and built. This will have
	  access to lv_conf.h already from LVGL. Additionally, another
	  configuration file, lv_drv_conf.h, is needed by lv_drivers in
	  order to configure the build properly.

	  Path to the lv_drv_conf.h file used to configure the
	  lv_drviers build.

	  Note that this is required in order to build a useful
	  lv_drivers library!

	  The path can be a URL beginning with ftp://, http://,
	  or https://. Otherwise, it will be assumed to be a file on
	  disk and will be copied from that path.
